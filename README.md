## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```


## How To Use 

From your command line, clone and run developerFolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/DheerajR1/porfolioReact.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd porfolioReact

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

#Start's development server
$ npm start
```

## Change and customize every section according to your need.

#### Personalize page content in `/src/profile.js` & modify it as per your need.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */


const header = { .... }

const about = { .... }

const skillsBar = { .... }

const projects = { .... }

const miscellaneous = { .... }

const contact = { .... }

const social = { .... }

```


## Deployment
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.


#### Deploying to Netlify

You could also host directly with Netlify by linking your own repository.
